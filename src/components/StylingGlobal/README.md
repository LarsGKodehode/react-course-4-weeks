# Using global (vanilla) CSS
More an example of how to apply CSS class names to React components than something you should use.
### Relevant files
- [StylingGlobal.jsx](./StylingGlobal.jsx)
- [index.css](/src/index.css)

## Pros
- No new knowledge required
## Cons
- Modularity
This component is now dependant on index.css, we want to keep all our dependecies inside this folder as far as possible. This is to make reusing component across projects painfree.
